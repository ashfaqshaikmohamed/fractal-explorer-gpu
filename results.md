- **Description:** Classic Mandelbrot set rendered at 1000Ã—1000 resolution with 500 iterations.  
- **Why it matters:** This is the baseline visualization recruiters expect â€” instantly recognizable and a good demonstration of correctness.  

### `mandelbrot_zoom1.png`
- **Region:** Seahorse Valley (around -0.75, 0.1).  
- **Description:** A zoomed-in view that reveals intricate spirals and repeating structures.  
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates support for interactive zooming and navigation.  

### `mandelbrot_zoom2.png`
- **Region:** Deeper zoom around (-0.7435, 0.131).  
- **Description:** Displays ultra-fine fractal details at high iteration counts.  
- **Why it matters:** Shows numerical stability and rendering precision.

## ðŸ”¹ Julia Sets

### `julia_c_-0.7_0.27015.png`
- **Parameters:** c = -0.7 + 0.27015i  
- **Description:** A connected Julia set with dendritic structures.  
- **Why it matters:** Highlights flexibility â€” the system supports Julia rendering in addition to Mandelbrot.  

### `julia_c_0.355_0.355.png`
- **Parameters:** c = 0.355 + 0.355i  
- **Description:** A Julia set that demonstrates symmetry and complexity.  
- **Why it matters:** Reinforces that the app can explore a wide parameter space for different fractals.

## ðŸ”¹ Performance Benchmark

### `performance_plot.png`
- **Description:** Comparison of CPU vs GPU rendering times at increasing image sizes.  
- **Key takeaway:** GPU rendering is ~20Ã— faster than the CPU implementation.  
- **Why it matters:** Shows the tangible benefit of parallel computing and OpenCL optimization.

## âœ… Summary
These results demonstrate:
1. **Visual correctness** â€” fractals appear as expected at multiple zoom levels.  
2. **Flexibility** â€” supports both Mandelbrot and Julia sets.  
3. **Performance gains** â€” GPU acceleration delivers a significant speedup.  

Recruiters and engineers reviewing this repo can quickly see both *technical competence* and *practical outcomes* without needing to run the code themselves.
